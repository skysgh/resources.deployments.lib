## Development Synopsis ## 
Github `yaml` based pipeline files can only be located in a folder called 
`.github/workflows` - so they can't be here.

Note:
I guess one could make callers/callees in that the callers
is in `.github/workflows` and the callee is here, but don't see
a good reason for that.
